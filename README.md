# Image Comparison app

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shobhan Sundar Goutam. This application is designed to compare two images by analyzing them pixel by pixel. When the similarity between the two images reaches or exceeds 90%, we consider them similar. If not, they are deemed different. Simple and effective for ensuring image consistency!
